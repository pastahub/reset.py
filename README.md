# reset.py
A single instance reset macro that (hopefully) works for every os. (If you use Mac or Linux please tell me if this works by messaging me on discord @pasta#3635)

To run, first make sure you have keyboard installed.
You can install keyboard with `pip install keyboard`.
Also make sure that settings.json is in the same directory as reset.py and that each option is correct.
You also need to have atum and fast reset installed for Minecraf, both of which can be found [here](https://www.minecraftspeedrunning.com/public-resources/mods).
Then just run reset.py and start resetting.

## Settings:

### reset_hotkey
The hotkey to reset the game. Use '+' to add multiple keys, such as `ctrl+u`.

### exit_hotkey
The hotkey which stops the macro. Same formatting as reset_hotkey.

### path
The path to your .minecraft folder.
