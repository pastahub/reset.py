# reset.py
A single instance reset macro that (hopefully) works for every os.

To run, first make sure you have keyboard installed.
You can install keyboard with `pip install keyboard`.
You also need to have atum and fast reset installed for Minecraf, both of which can be found [here](https://www.minecraftspeedrunning.com/public-resources/mods).

## Settings:

### reset_hotkey
The hotkey to reset the game. Use '+' to add multiple keys, such as `ctrl+u`

### exit_hotkey
The hotkey which stops the macro

### path
The path to your .minecraft folder
